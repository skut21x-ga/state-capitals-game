# State Capitals

Created a game to help us memorize the names of the capitals of all 50 states.

## Prerequisites

- Basics of programming with Python

You can execute a python file by doing `python3 lib/script.py`

## Requirements

To play the game:

- Your program should prompt the user to identify the capital associated with a
  given state.
- There should be running tallies on the number of correct and incorrect answers
  for each state
- After getting through all 50 states one time, users should be asked whether or
  not they want to play again.

### Game Requirements

- Make sure the states don't appear in alphabetical order in the prompts. This
  will make the game a bit more challenging for the user.
- Provide a welcome message to introduce the player to the game.
- Through all 50 states, prompt the user to name the capital of the state.
- Score whether the user's guess is correct or not.
- Calculate a overall total score, display a running tally after each prompt
- Once the user has gone through all 50 states, ask them if they'd like to play
  again.
